# Group Contract

## Members

- Chris Danner
- Wolf Mermelstein

## Instructions

All students are expected to work in groups of 2-3 students for the group
projects. Everyone should join the same Project 1 group on Canvas (the groups
are located on the People tab). Once you complete the contract and all members
sign, only one person in the group has to submit.

Please write up a contract for your group. All members of the group should
sign the contract. Once everyone has agreed to the contract and signed it, one
member of the group should submit the contract.

What are you doing this? Team work and small group learning has long been shown
to enhance the learning of students. However, to show benefits, the group
needs to be productive. By setting realistic and reasonable expectations for
your group, you can have a positive learning experience.

What should go into the contract? The contract should cover your expectations.
Here are some suggested areas that the contract should cover. What finally
goes into the contract is up to you, but you should put some thought and
details into it. A sparse contract risks creating a dysfunctional group.

## Meetings

How often will the group meet?
- 1-2 times per week, as needed

Do you want to set a regular time for meetings?
- Regularish. We will meet evenings when we are both free

What should someone do if they can't make a meeting?
- Find another time that works

What is expected that each member will do prior to the meeting to prepare for
the meeting?
- What we agreed they would do at the previous meeting

## Behaviors

What is expected behavior from group members and what is unacceptable?

Possible examples of expected behavior: listening to other members with
respect, allowing others to finish talking without interruption, contributing
to all group discussions

Possible examples of unacceptable behavior: sexist, racist or other
discriminatory remarks, aggressive or dominating behavior, ghosting other
members of the group

- Agree to do work by a time, do the work by that time
- Doing things that offend or are inconsiderate to the other group member

## Division of Labor

How will decisions be made about how the work will be divided?
- We will look at assignments when we are meeting in person and discuss
verbally what we feel a good distribution of work is. 

What will you use for a shared code repository?
-

How often are group members expected to update their work?
-

How often will work be reviewed by the group?
-

## Expectations

What grade are you striving for on the project?

- A

Is it acceptable for a group member who wants a higher grade to do more of the
work?

- No, because it would be at the cost of the other group member. We both would
like a high grade and will make an effort to contribute similarly.

Is it acceptable for a group member to change expectations to a lower grade in
the middle of the project?

- No. We agree that we both will make our best efforts for the assignment and
will avoid compromising for a lower grade.

## Conflict Resolution

What should the first steps be if there is a conflict between group members?

- Determine exactly what the conflict is about, and determine if we can find a

compromise. If not, then explain our sides logically and try to figure out why
we disagree.

How should disagreements be resolved (ex: majority vote, consensus, etc.)?

- Depends on severity. If we have a disagreement about how to do something,
then we can delegate doing that thing to one person so that they can do it the
way they want, and then other parts of the assignment can be delegated to the
other person similarly.

When is it appropriate to involve the TA or instructor of the course?

- If either of us:

1) Does not respond to the other groupmate after multiple messages over two
days or more, or the deadline is very soon (with disgression) and they aren't
getting back or contributing.
2) If you do not feel they are doing a fair share of the work, and they
disagree and refuse to come to a resolution together.
3) If we are confused about how to do something or are curious/want a third
party input about whose approach we should take.
