# Group Contract

All students are expected to work in groups of 2-3 students for the group
projects.  Everyone should join the same Project 1 group on Canvas (the groups
are located on the People tab).  Once you complete the contract and all members
sign, only one person in the group has to submit.

Please write up a contract for your group.  All members of the group should
sign the contract.  Once everyone has agreed to the contract and signed it, one
member of the group should submit the contract.

What are you doing this? Team work and small group learning has long been shown
to enhance the learning of students.  However, to show benefits, the group
needs to be productive. By setting realistic and reasonable expectations for
your group, you can have a positive learning experience.
-

What should go into the contract?  The contract should cover your expectations.
Here are some suggested areas that the contract should cover.  What finally
goes into the contract is up to you, but you should put some thought and
details into it.  A sparse contract risks creating a dysfunctional group.
