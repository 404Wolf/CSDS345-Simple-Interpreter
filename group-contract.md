# Group Contract

## Members

- Christopher Danner
- Wolf Mermelstein

## Instructions

All students are expected to work in groups of 2-3 students for the group
projects. Everyone should join the same Project 1 group on Canvas (the groups
are located on the People tab). Once you complete the contract and all members
sign, only one person in the group has to submit.

Please write up a contract for your group. All members of the group should
sign the contract. Once everyone has agreed to the contract and signed it, one
member of the group should submit the contract.

What are you doing this? Team work and small group learning has long been shown
to enhance the learning of students. However, to show benefits, the group
needs to be productive. By setting realistic and reasonable expectations for
your group, you can have a positive learning experience.

What should go into the contract? The contract should cover your expectations.
Here are some suggested areas that the contract should cover. What finally
goes into the contract is up to you, but you should put some thought and
details into it. A sparse contract risks creating a dysfunctional group.

## Meetings

As a group, we will meet weekly on Mondays at 6:30 PM, with additional meetings
organized as needed. Meetings will be focused on providing progress updates
from each group member and creating opportunities for group members to get help
from the rest of the group if they get stuck. If someone cannot make a meeting,
we will reschedule to a mutually agreeable time. Before each meeting, each
member is expected to have completed all assigned tasks from the previous
meeting, and any associated code updates should be pushed to the proper branch
of the GitHub repository.

## Behaviors

At meetings, group members are expected to listen to one another respectfully
and refrain from interrupting. All group members are expected to contribute to
project discussions both in and out of meetings, and group members are expected
to complete any work they agreed to complete by the time they agreed to have it
completed. Discriminatory remarks or aggressive behavior of any kind will not
be tolerated and will be immediately reported to the instructor if the behavior
does not change after a conversation with the offending individual. Similarly,
“ghosting” of the group is unacceptable and will be reported to the instructor
if the behavior does not change after two or more attempts are made to contact
the offending individual and no response is received within 24 hours.

## Division of Labor

Work will be divided by agreement between all group members at the first group
meeting after an assignment has been released, or over the Discord group
message if a decision must be reached earlier. All code changes will be
uploaded to a shared GitHub repository, and code changes are expected to be
pushed to the repository within 24 hours of when the changes are made. Group
members should ensure that their code is updated each week prior to the group
meeting unless there is no current assignment or their portion of the current
assignment is entirely complete. Code will be reviewed weekly by the entire
group, whether at the group meeting or independently after the meeting. Code
changes should never be pushed to the main branch until after they have been
reviewed and approved by the entire group.

## Expectations

As a group, we are striving to get an A on the project. Since all group
members have equally high expectations for the project, there should not be
any need for individual group members to do more of the work in order to
ensure a higher grade. If a group member changes their grade expectations
in the middle of the project, they should not allow that to impact their
overall level of contribution to the project and the quality of work they
submit. We all agree that we both will make our best efforts for the
assignment and will avoid compromising for a lower grade.

## Conflict Resolution

If there is a conflict between group members, we will first attempt to identify
the point of disagreement and seek to find a mutually agreeable compromise.
Disagreement resolution will depend on the scope of the issue. In the case
where there is a disagreement about how to do something (e.g., a disagreement
over implementation), then whoever the task is delegated to will have the final
say. If it is an issue which affects the entire project, an agreement will
attempt to be reached by consensus. Involving a TA or the instructor is
appropriate in any of the following situations:

1) If a group member does not respond to communication within 24 hours after
multiple attempts at correspondence. If the deadline is very soon (at the
contactor's discretion) the instructor or TA may be involved sooner.
2) If there are persistent disagreements over a decision which requires group
concensus (such as delegation of work).
3) If we are confused about how to do something or want a third-party input
about whose approach we should take.
